# CS7641 HW4 - Markov Decision Processes

## Github Repo for Code, Data
https://github.com/tracetidwell/cs7641/tree/master/hw_4

There are two main files for code: MDPs.ipynb, Analysis.ipynb
Running the Jupyter notebooks is very straightforward. All of the necessary libraries are imported at the top, and any additional methods are also defined.
Run all cells in order to run algorithms or generate analysis used

### MDPs.ipynb
* Algorithms and Functions
	* Methods for running experiments, gathering and printing results
	* GridWorld class
	* ValueIteration class
	* PolicyIteration class
	* Q-Learning class
* Solve MDPs
	* Define environments
	* Run all solvers on experiments

### Analysis.ipynb
* VI and PI Results
* QL Results

Python Environment
* python 3.7
* scikitlearn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
